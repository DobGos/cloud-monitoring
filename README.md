Researching tools available for monitoring microservices that are runing in a cloud as dockerised images.  


h3. Monitoring in AWS clous - X-Ray
I am creating two sample microservices which will run on two AWS EC2 boxes. 
* [Sample backend microservice](./sample-backend-microservice) - Java 8, spring-boot. Deployed as a docker image.
* [Sample frontend microservice](./sample-backend-microservice) - Angular 2, node. Deployed as a docker image.
