Researching tools available for monitoring microservices that are runing in a cloud as dockerised images.  


# Monitoring in AWS cloud - X-Ray
I am creating two sample microservices which will run on two AWS EC2 boxes. Microservices will be deployed as docker images. 
* [Sample backend microservice](./sample-backend-microservice) - Java 8, spring-boot.
* [Sample frontend microservice](./sample-frontend-microservice) - Angular (v.4), Node.js.

AWS X-Ray presented here: [An Overview of Designing Microservices - March 2017 AWS](./designing-microservices-monitoring.md) by Peter Dalbhanjan.
